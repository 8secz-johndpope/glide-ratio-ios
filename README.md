# GlideRatio (iOS) project

GlideRatio is iOS application to calculate minimal glide ratio (of a wing) required to fly your line in 
Speedflying, Paragliding, Basejumping and other Paralpnisme activities.

It's simple (useful) application with minimalistic UI / UX to use it in your Hike&Fly missions.

Application uses rear camera, accelerometer and magnetometer (compass) sensors to detect the tilt angle of your flying line and then 
to calculate the minimal glide ratio.

You only need to point your camera to landing zone or to potential takeoff area.

Fly safe.

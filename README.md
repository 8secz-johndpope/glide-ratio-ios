# GlideRatio (iOS) project

[GlideRatio (iOS) on Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/glideratio/id1502810830)

First, many thanks to my Bulgarian friends: Andrey Manolov and Emil Gyorev.  
For the great idea to create this application. If it was not for your help and encouragement,  
this project would not have been successful.

This application uses rear camera and motion sensors of your phone to detect  
minimal glide ratio required to safely run (fly) lines in your Hike&Fly missions.

Two modes of detection: from landing zone and from takeoff site.

Use zoom feature to point your camera to destination accurate.

Minimalistic UI (no stupid buttons, controls, etc): Just point your camera to landing (or to takeoff) zone,  
boom - you can see calculated glide ratio immediately.

Fly safe.
